//Mod 1: Changed background color
//Mod 2: Changed click sound effect
//Mod 3: Made clicking beads cycle through more than two colors
//Mod 4: Made exiting a bead (moving the cursor off of a bead) cycle through colors and play a click sound effect
//Mod 5: Made entering a bead (moving the mouse cursor over a bead) apply an infinity glyph onto the bead
//Mod 6: Expanded grid from 7x7 to 21x21

Called once after engine is initialized but before event-polling begins.

Any value returned is ignored.
