PS.init( system, options )
Called once after engine is initialized but before event-polling begins.
This function doesn't have to do anything, although initializing the grid dimensions with PS.gridSize() is recommended.
If PS.grid() is not called, the default grid dimensions (8 x 8 beads) are applied.
Any value returned is ignored.
[system : Object] = A JavaScript object containing engine and host platform information properties; see API documentation for details.
[options : Object] = A JavaScript object with optional data properties; see API documentation for details.

/*

General layout:
	-spawn object
	-every action, decrease counter via FAKE_TICK()
	-if player object attempts to move off grid, return and do not decrease counter (maybe play a noise)
	-if player attempts to move into a space occupied by an interactable object, interact based on the type
		-pushable objects:
			-if the space adjacent to the object in the direction of the player's movement is empty and not off-grid, then
				-move the object to that space
				-move the player to the object's space
			-else do nothing, maybe play a bump sound effect
		-consumables
			-apply the bonus the consumable grants to the player
			-remove the consumable
		-goal
			-re-initialize using next level's data
	-once the counter reaches 0, game over
